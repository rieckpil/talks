# Testing Spring Boot Applications Demystified

## Notes

```
dcover create de.rieckpil.talks.CustomerController
```

```
Example: following my TDD instructions, implement a Spring Boot
  Web REST API to fetch the stock price from a given
  company using their ticker symbol (e.g. MSTR), use the
  Spring WebClient and implement meaningful unit and
  integration tests in a test-driven manner
```
