## Hands-On

[![Open in GitHub Codespaces](https://github.com/codespaces/badge.svg)](https://codespaces.new/rieckpil/talks)

Create a new development environment via [GitHub Codespaces](https://codespaces.new/rieckpil/talksg). Choose a _Region_ close to where you live and select at least a 4-core machine (8-core would be better). GitHub will automatically open the development environment in a Visual Studio Code instance in your web browser.

Don't forget to [shut down the codespace](https://github.com/codespaces) afterward to avoid costs (check your usage [here](https://github.com/settings/billing/summary)).

**Talk description**: Testing plays a crucial role in software development, allowing you to catch bugs, ensure your code functions as intended, and provide confidence in the reliability and stability of your applications.

However, testing Spring Boot applications can sometimes feel like navigating a labyrinth of challenges ‚Äì from managing dependencies and external systems to crafting effective tests that reflect the behavior of your code.

Whether you‚Äôre a seasoned developer or just starting your journey with Spring Boot, this workshop is designed to unravel the complexities and pitfalls of testing Spring Boot applications and empower you to become more productive and confident in your testing efforts.

In this workshop, we will demystify testing Spring Boot applications by providing you with clear explanations, practical insights, and actionable best practices. Philip will guide you through the common pitfalls faced by developers, share time-tested recipes for success, and equip you with the tools and knowledge you need to write comprehensive and effective tests.

## How Fixing a Broken Window Cut Down Our Build Time by 50%

**Talk description**: The broken windows (not the operating system - üòÅ) theory not only applies to criminological cases but also codebases. It only takes one lazy developer to break the first window. Chances are high that others will follow a similar path and take workarounds or re-apply a not so optimal pattern thinking, "It passed the code review, I must not be that bad".

For our Spring Boot integration test setup, we had such a broken window that was causing ever-growing build times. While most books about clean architecture emphasize composition over inheritance, we drifted off from this rule and coupled our tests to an AbstractIntegrationTest class that we then annotated with `@DirtiesContext`...

This resulted in ever-growing build times as each new integration test was launching its own Spring TestContext, adding valuable seconds to the overall build time. Our feedback cycles, as well as the overall satisfaction of the team, started to suffer from this.

This talk describes our journey of getting rid of `@DirtiesContext` on top of an abstract test class (aka. the "broken window") that made reusing the Spring TestContext impossible and resulted in ever-growing build times. Furthermore, we'll discuss recipes, best practices, and antipatterns for resuing the Spring TestContext and testing Spring Boot applications in general.

After fixing this "broken window", our overall build time went down by 50% from 25 to 12 minutes.

## Things I Wish I Knew When I Started Testing Spring Boot Applications

**Talk description**: Getting started with Spring Boot and its auto-configuration mechanism can be a hurdle for new developers.

Once you get your first Spring Boot application up- and running, writing tests for it is the last thing you care about. You‚Äôre happy that your code does its job.

However, as soon as you try to integrate your changes, you face a pull request rejection because your lead developer reminds you that tests are missing.

Testing is an integral part of software development, and unfortunately, some teams treat this topic neglectfully. That‚Äôs bad for the future maintenance and overall health of their project. Fortunately, both Spring Test and Spring Boot offer excellent support for testing your application.

This talk will give you an overview of best practices, pitfalls, and recipes for testing Spring Boot applications. Simply put, with this talk, I‚Äôll share the things that I wish I had known when I started testing Spring Boot applications.
